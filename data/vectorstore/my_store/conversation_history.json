        "answer": "Based on the provided context, I can identify three main types of Machine Learning (ML):\n\n1. **Supervised Learning**: The model learns from labeled data, where the input and output pairs are provided.\n2. **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for actions, and improving based on this feedback.\n\nThere is no mention of a fourth type of Machine Learning in the provided context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the question about the four main types of machine learning and how they differ.",
